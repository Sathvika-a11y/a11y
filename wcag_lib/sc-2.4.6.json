"do": [ 
"Use clear, descriptive text for headings that convey the topic or purpose of the section", 
"Ensure every form control has a visible label that describes its purpose",
"Keep labels brief while conveying enough context to distinguish identical controls", 
"Use aria-label for icon-only controls when no visible text exists", 
"Ensure heading text accurately matches the content that follows" 
],

"dont": [ 
"Do not use generic labels like 'Click here', 'More', 'Submit' without context", 
"Do not omit labels on form controls, including image buttons and SVG icons", 
"Do not skip heading levels (e.g., jump from h1 to h3 without h2)", 
"Do not use <div> or <span> as headings without ARIA roles", 
"Do not rely on placeholder text alone as a label", 
"Do not rely solely on color, position, or font size to denote headings or labels", 
"Do not duplicate the same heading text for unrelated sections", 
"Do not visually hide headings (<display:none>) when they are needed for structure", 
"Do not use aria-label when a native <label> element can provide the same functionality", 
"Do not abbreviate or truncate labels in ways that reduce clarity", 
"Do not inject heading or label text using CSS pseudo-elements only", 
"Do not leave empty headings (no text content) to create spacing" 
], 
"edge_cases": [ 
"Repeated links with identical label text but different URLs: prepend context (e.g., 'Blog: Article Title')", 
"Language switcher links: include language name and region code (e.g., 'Español (ES)')", 
"Image-based submit controls: use aria-label matching the input’s function (e.g., 'Search')",
"Custom dropdown controls: ensure trigger element has an accessible name reflecting current selection", 
"Notification banners: include a heading level and aria-label for close buttons", 
"Video player controls: each button (play, mute, captions) must have aria-label", 
"Pagination controls: 'Next'/'Previous' must include context (e.g., 'Next page of results')",  
"Data visualizations: controls to filter data must have descriptive labels", 
"Language attribute changes: headings and labels must update visible and accessible text", 
"Geolocation permission prompts: label indicates permission and purpose"
