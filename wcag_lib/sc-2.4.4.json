    "Include file type and size for downloadable resources (e.g., “Download brochure (PDF, 2 MB)”)","Use active verbs that describe the action (e.g., “Register for webinar”, “View seating chart”)",
    "Use unique link text within a page to avoid repetition (e.g., “View privacy policy” vs. “View cookie policy”)",
    "If link text is an image, provide alt text conveying the same purpose","For links opening new windows, indicate this in link text or context (e.g., “Read more (opens in new tab)”)",
    "Combine visible link text with aria-label when additional context is needed","For “Learn more” type links, ensure adjacent heading or sentence provides specific topic context",
    "Use breadcrumbs as links with descriptive labels (e.g., “Home > Products > Lenses”)",
    "Group related links under a meaningful heading or list context","For pagination links, include page numbers and context (e.g., “Page 2 of 10”)",
    "For error summary links, describe target field (e.g., “Go to error: Email address missing”)",
    "Use link text for skip-links that describe section (e.g., “Skip to main navigation”)",
    "In tables, use link text plus column/row context (e.g., “Edit row 3 details”)",
    "Use meaningful link text in navigation menus (e.g., “Services”, “Contact us”)",

  "dont": [
    "Do not use generic link text like “Click here”, “Read more”, “More info” without context","Do not repeat the same link text for different destinations on the same page",

    "Do not rely on color, underlining alone to indicate link purpose","Do not hide link purpose in tooltip only",
    "Do not omit indication when link opens in a new tab/window","Do not use non-descriptive link text within buttons (e.g., “Submit” as link)",
    "Do not depend on surrounding visual context that screen readers may not announce","Do not use long URLs as link text","Do not use icon-only links without aria-label or visible text",
    "Do not include entire sentences as link text","Do not use repeated phrases like “More details” without context","Do not assume users know file extensions or acronyms used in link text",

    "Image-based links (e.g., banner ads): alt text must convey target page purpose","Links in form error summaries: include field name and error type","Links in tooltips or popovers: ensure visible context and link text clarity",
    "Links in data tables: include row and column context (e.g., “Download invoice for Order #12345”)",
    "Links generated dynamically (e.g., infinite scroll ‘Load more’): include context of content loaded","Links in carousels/sliders: each slide’s link text must be unique and descriptive",
    "Downloadable CSV/Excel export links: include file format (e.g., “Export data to CSV”)",
    "Links to email addresses: use “Email support at support@example.com” rather than raw “support@example.com”",
    "Links in footers: ensure descriptive text (e.g., “Terms of service”)","Links to maps: describe purpose (e.g., “View office location on Google Maps”)",
    "Links for screen reader only: ensure aria-label describes purpose","Links within captions/figures: include context (e.g., “View full-size image of chart”)",
    "Links to PDFs embedded in iframes: include format in text (e.g., “Open site map (PDF)”)","Links in multi-lingual sites: include language code when linking cross-language pages",
    "Links that trigger downloads via scripting: ensure link text indicates download","Links that launch applications or protocols (e.g., “Open in Zoom”): include application name"
