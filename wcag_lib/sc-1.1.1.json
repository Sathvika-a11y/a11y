  "do": [
    "Provide meaningful, descriptive text alternatives that convey the same information or purpose as the non-text content",
    "For informational images: describe the content and meaning of the image accurately and concisely",
    "For functional images (inside links/buttons): describe the action or destination (e.g., 'Search', 'Go to Pricing', 'Home page')",
    "For complex images (charts, diagrams, graphs): provide both short alt text and a detailed long description using figure/figcaption, adjacent text, or aria-describedby",
    "Mark purely decorative images with empty alt (alt=\"\") or role=\"presentation\" to hide from assistive technology",
    "Use aria-label or aria-labelledby when native alt attribute is not available (e.g., SVG icons, CSS background images)",
    "For image maps: provide alternative text for each area element that describes the link destination or function",
    "For CAPTCHA: provide text that identifies the purpose AND offer alternative forms for different sensory modalities (audio, cognitive tests)",
    "For time-based media: provide descriptive identification at minimum (full alternatives covered under 1.2)",
    "For form controls with images (input type='image'): ensure accessible name describes the button's purpose/function, not appearance",
    "Update alt text when the image content or purpose changes dynamically",
    "Include color information in alt text when color conveys meaning or is essential to understanding",
    "For mathematical expressions: use MathML when possible, or provide comprehensive text alternatives using mathematical notation conventions",
    "For ASCII art and text-look-alikes: provide complete text alternative that conveys the same information",
    "For test/exercise images: provide descriptive identification without giving away answers",
    "For sensory experiences (art, music): provide descriptive identification and context when feasible",
    "Keep simple alt text concise (under 125-250 characters) and move longer descriptions to separate mechanisms",
    "For image buttons and controls: describe the action/function, not the visual appearance",
    "For linked images: describe the link destination or purpose, not just image content",
    "For thumbnail images: describe what the full-size version contains or where clicking leads",
    "Use appropriate semantic markup (figure/figcaption) for complex image descriptions",
    "Test alt text by having it read aloud to ensure it makes sense in context"
  ],
  "dont": [
    "Do not use generic, placeholder, or filename text like 'image', 'photo', 'graphic', 'IMG_1234.png', 'click here'",
    "Do not duplicate adjacent visible text in alt when it already names the same control or target",
    "Do not put long descriptions (over 125-250 characters) in alt; use separate long descriptions instead",
    "Do not leave functional images (buttons, links) with empty or missing alt text",
    "Do not use redundant phrases like 'image of', 'picture of', 'graphic showing' - screen readers already announce element type",
    "Do not provide alt text for purely decorative images - use alt=\"\" or role=\"presentation\" instead",
    "Do not use CSS background images for informational content without providing alternative text mechanism",
    "Do not use text-look-alikes or ASCII art without comprehensive text alternatives",
    "Do not rely solely on color to convey information in images without describing color relationships in alt text",
    "Do not use meaningless alt text like 'spacer', 'bullet', 'separator' for decorative images",
    "Do not fail to update alt text when image content changes (F20 failure)",
    "Do not omit alt attribute entirely on img, area, and input type='image' elements (F65 failure)",
    "Do not use alt text that doesn't include information conveyed by color differences (F13 failure)",
    "Do not provide long descriptions that don't serve the same purpose as the original content (F67 failure)",
    "Do not use CSS to include informational images without providing text alternatives (F3 failure)",
    "Do not use filenames or placeholder text as alternatives (F30 failure)",
    "Do not incorrectly mark informational images as decorative (F38/F39 failures)",
    "Do not use title attribute alone as text alternative - it's not reliably accessible",
    "Do not assume all users will see hover states or tooltips",
    "Do not use longdesc attribute (deprecated/obsolete in HTML5)"

  "edge_cases": [
    "Linked logos: alt should describe destination or organization (e.g., 'ACME Corporation home page', not just 'ACME logo')",
    "CSS background images: ensure separate text label exists via aria-label, visible text, or other programmatically determinable means",
    "Icon-only controls: provide accessible name via aria-label, aria-labelledby, or adjacent visible text",
    "Image groups: one image can describe the entire group, others marked as decorative with alt=\"\"",
    "Live video/audio: provide descriptive identification, full alternatives covered under 1.2",
    "Sensory experiences (art, music): provide descriptive identification and context when possible without diminishing the experience",
    "Test/exercise images: provide descriptive identification but not answers that would invalidate the test",
    "Decorative spacers/bullets/borders: use alt=\"\" or role=\"presentation\"",
    "Images within links: describe the link destination, not just the image content",
    "Thumbnail images: describe what the full-size version contains or where the link leads",
    "Charts/graphs: short alt summarizes the data trend, long description provides detailed data points and relationships",
    "Emotional/atmospheric content: describe the emotion or atmosphere the image conveys when relevant to content purpose",
    "Mathematical equations: simple equations can use alt text, complex ones need MathML or detailed textual representation",
    "Infographics: require both summary alt text and comprehensive long description covering all information presented",
    "Image carousels: each image needs appropriate alt text, carousel controls need functional descriptions",
    "Screenshots: describe the relevant content and interface elements shown",
    "Memes and social media images: describe visual content and any text shown in the image",
    "QR codes and barcodes: provide the encoded information in text form",
    "Company logos in navigation: describe destination (e.g., 'Home') rather than just company name",
    "Image-based form inputs: alt text should describe the button's function (e.g., 'Submit form', 'Search')",
    "Repeated decorative elements: consistently mark as decorative throughout the site",
    "Context-dependent images: same image may need different alt text depending on surrounding content and purpose",
    "Progressive disclosure images: alt text should indicate the action (e.g., 'Show more details')",
    "Before/after comparison images: alt text should indicate which version is shown and key differences"
