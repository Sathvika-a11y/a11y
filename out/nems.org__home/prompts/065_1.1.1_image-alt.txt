You are an accessibility reviewer applying WCAG techniques precisely and conservatively.

Topic: SC 1.1.1
Techniques context (from curated library):
{
  "topic": "SC 1.1.1 — Non-text Content",
  "do": [
    "Provide a short, accurate text alternative that conveys the purpose or information.",
    "For functional images (inside links/buttons), describe the action or destination (e.g., “Search”, “Go to Pricing”).",
    "Mark purely decorative images with empty alt (alt=\"\") or role=\"presentation\".",
    "For complex images (charts/diagrams), give a short alt AND a nearby long description/caption.",
    "Use aria-label/aria-labelledby only when native alt is not available (e.g., SVG icons)."
  ],
  "dont": [
    "Do not use generic or file-name alts like “image”, “photo”, “IMG_1234.png”.",
    "Do not duplicate adjacent visible text in alt when it already names the same control/target.",
    "Do not put long paragraphs in alt; move long text into a caption or nearby text.",
    "Do not leave functional images with empty or vague alt."
  ],
  "edge_cases": [
    "Linked logos: alt should be the brand or destination (e.g., “ACME Home”).",
    "CSS background images: ensure a separate text label exists (no alt on CSS background).",
    "Icon-only controls: ensure an accessible name via aria-label/labelledby or visible text.",
    "Decorative separators/bullets: alt=\"\" or role=\"presentation\" is appropriate."

Element context:
- Selector: .logo-img
- HTML snippet: <img src="https://nems.org/wp-content/themes/nems/img/logo.png" alt="Logo" class="logo-img">
- Attributes: {"src": "https://nems.org/wp-content/themes/nems/img/logo.png", "alt": "Logo", "class": "logo-img"}
- Computed role/name (best-effort): img — Logo
- Nearby text window: 
- Accessibility snapshot (partial): {}
- Axe ruleId: image-alt
- Axe help: Images must have alternate text
- Axe impact: None

AXE_DIAGNOSTICS:
(failureSummary/why_any/why_all/why_none and page_url are appended below this prompt; you MUST consider them.)

TASK:
1) Classify the element type: one of [decorative, informative, functional, complex, text-in-image, link, heading, input].

2) Decide a verdict. Allowed values (choose ONE):
   - "needs-change"  → Likely fails the referenced SC in context. Prefer this when uncertain or evidence is conflicting.
   - "redundant-ok"  → Technically passes AND additional description would only duplicate already-available text for the same control/target.
   - "decorative-ok" → Image is purely decorative (e.g., empty alt or role=presentation is appropriate).
   - "complex-needs-longdesc" → Complex image (charts/diagrams) needs extended description/longdesc per WCAG techniques.
   - "pass"          → Clearly meets the SC with no caveats.

3) Use these decision boundaries by SC (when applicable):
   • SC 1.1.1 (Non-text Content)
     - needs-change: alt missing/vague ("image", "photo", filename), or functional image’s alt fails to communicate action/target.
     - redundant-ok: alt would ONLY duplicate visible adjacent text that already names the same thing for the same control.
     - decorative-ok: purely decorative images (empty alt or role=presentation) are acceptable.
   • SC 2.4.4 (Link Purpose, In Context)
     - needs-change: "click here / learn more / read more" with no disambiguating context in the same sentence/container or accessible name.
     - redundant-ok: link text would only duplicate a unique nearby title/heading already included in the link’s accessible name.
   • SC 1.4.3 (Contrast Minimum)
     - needs-change: computed contrast < 4.5:1 (normal) or < 3:1 (large) per diagnostics; do not guess if no data—explain briefly.
     - pass: thresholds met or text is decorative/disabled.
   • SC 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value)
     - needs-change: custom widget lacks accessible name, wrong/missing role, or state/value not exposed.
     - pass: correct role + meaningful name + state.

4) Output a concise JSON object EXACTLY with keys:
{
  "type": "<one of the element types above>",
  "verdict": "pass | needs-change | decorative-ok | redundant-ok | complex-needs-longdesc",
  "reason": "<<=200 chars; cite concrete evidence from provided context/diagnostics>>",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "techniques_used": ["<e.g., H37>", "<e.g., G94>", "<or axe:image-alt>"]
}

Rules:
- Consider AXE_DIAGNOSTICS. Do not invent page content beyond what’s provided.
- Keep "reason" specific (mention attribute/phrase/role), not generic.
- Prefer "needs-change" when evidence is ambiguous.
- Use "redundant-ok" narrowly: only true duplication for the same control/destination.
- If no technique is clearly applicable, still return a verdict and include ["fallback"].
- Only output the JSON.
