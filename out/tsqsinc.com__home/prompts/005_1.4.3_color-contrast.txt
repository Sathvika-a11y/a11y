Element context:
- Selector: .card:nth-child(1) > .know-more-btn[role="link"]
- HTML snippet: <button class="know-more-btn" aria-label="Know More About Quality Transformation" role="link">Know More</button>
- Attributes: {"class": "know-more-btn", "aria-label": "Know More About Quality Transformation", "role": "link"}
- Computed role/name (best-effort): link â€” Know More About Quality Transformation
- Nearby text window: Know More
- Accessibility snapshot (partial): {"role": "link", "name": "Know More About Quality Transformation"}
- Axe ruleId: color-contrast
- Axe help: Elements must meet minimum color contrast ratio thresholds
- Axe impact: serious

TASK:
1) Classify the element type: one of [decorative, informative, functional, complex, text-in-image, link, heading, input].
2) Judge adequacy against the techniques. Consider redundancy (e.g., if link/button already has a good accessible name).
3) Return a concise JSON object with:
   {
     "type": "...",
     "verdict": "pass | needs-change | decorative-ok | redundant-ok | complex-needs-longdesc",
     "reason": "...",
     "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
     "techniques_used": ["...","..."]
   }

Only output the JSON.
