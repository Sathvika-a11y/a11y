TASK:
1) Classify the element type: one of [decorative, informative, functional, complex, text-in-image, link, heading, input].
2) Judge adequacy against the techniques. Consider redundancy (e.g., if link/button already has a good accessible name).
3) Return a concise JSON object with:
   {
     "type": "...",
     "verdict": "pass | needs-change | decorative-ok | redundant-ok | complex-needs-longdesc",
     "reason": "...",
     "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
     "techniques_used": ["...","..."]
   }

Only output the JSON.
