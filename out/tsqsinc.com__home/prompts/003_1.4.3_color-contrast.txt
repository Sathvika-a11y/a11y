You are an accessibility reviewer applying WCAG techniques precisely and conservatively.

  "topic": "SC 1.4.3",
  "do": [
    "Apply WCAG techniques conservatively for this SC.",

Element context:
- Selector: button[aria-label="Read More About Our Expertise"]
- HTML snippet: <button class="read-more-btn" role="link" aria-label="Read More About Our Expertise">Read More</button>
- Attributes: {"class": "read-more-btn", "role": "link", "aria-label": "Read More About Our Expertise"}
- Computed role/name (best-effort): link â€” Read More About Our Expertise
- Nearby text window: Read More
- Accessibility snapshot (partial): {"role": "link", "name": "Read More About Our Expertise"}
- Axe ruleId: color-contrast
- Axe help: Elements must meet minimum color contrast ratio thresholds
- Axe impact: serious

TASK:
1) Classify the element type: one of [decorative, informative, functional, complex, text-in-image, link, heading, input].
2) Judge adequacy against the techniques. Consider redundancy (e.g., if link/button already has a good accessible name).
3) Return a concise JSON object with:
   {
     "type": "...",
     "verdict": "pass | needs-change | decorative-ok | redundant-ok | complex-needs-longdesc",
     "reason": "...",
     "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
     "techniques_used": ["...","..."]
   }

Only output the JSON.
