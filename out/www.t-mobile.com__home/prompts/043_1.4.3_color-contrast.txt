Element context:
- Selector: .unav-nav__item[x-data="{ open: false }"][data-customer="any"]:nth-child(8) > .unav-nav__children > li[data-customer="any"]:nth-child(1) > a[target="_self"]
- HTML snippet: <a href="/responsibility/legal/return-policy?INTNAV=fNav%3AAdditionalSupport%3AViewReturnPolicy" data-analytics-navigation-name="Additional support|View return policy" target="_self">View return policy</a>
- Attributes: {"href": "/responsibility/legal/return-policy?INTNAV=fNav%3AAdditionalSupport%3AViewReturnPolicy", "data-analytics-navigation-name": "Additional support|View return policy", "target": "_self"}

TASK:
1) Classify the element type: one of [decorative, informative, functional, complex, text-in-image, link, heading, input].
2) Judge adequacy against the techniques. Consider redundancy (e.g., if link/button already has a good accessible name).
3) Return a concise JSON object with:
   {
     "type": "...",
     "verdict": "pass | needs-change | decorative-ok | redundant-ok | complex-needs-longdesc",
     "reason": "...",
     "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
     "techniques_used": ["...","..."]
   }

Only output the JSON.
