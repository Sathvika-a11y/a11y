Element context:
- Selector: button[data-rte-modal-type="modal:xf"]
- HTML snippet: <button data-rte-modal-type="modal:xf" x-data="a11yDialogButton('/content/experience-fragments/digx/tmobile/us/en/modals/xftmo-powerline-hp/master.html')" type="button" data-a11y-dialog-show="powerline">Get full terms</button>
- Attributes: {"data-rte-modal-type": "modal:xf", "x-data": "a11yDialogButton('/content/experience-fragments/digx/tmobile/us/en/modals/xftmo-powerline-hp/master.html')", "type": "button", "data-a11y-dialog-show": "powerline"}
- Computed role/name (best-effort): button â€” Get full terms
- Nearby text window: Get full terms
- Accessibility snapshot (partial): {"role": "button", "name": "Get full terms"}
- Axe ruleId: color-contrast
- Axe help: Elements must meet minimum color contrast ratio thresholds
- Axe impact: serious

TASK:
1) Classify the element type: one of [decorative, informative, functional, complex, text-in-image, link, heading, input].
2) Judge adequacy against the techniques. Consider redundancy (e.g., if link/button already has a good accessible name).
3) Return a concise JSON object with:
   {
     "type": "...",
     "verdict": "pass | needs-change | decorative-ok | redundant-ok | complex-needs-longdesc",
     "reason": "...",
     "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
     "techniques_used": ["...","..."]
   }

Only output the JSON.
